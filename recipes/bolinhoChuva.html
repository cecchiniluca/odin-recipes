<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bolinho de Chuva are the Brazilian equivalent of Beginets: deep fried dough in raindrop shape, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Sugar and cinnamon</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Butter and milk</li>
    <li>Oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk the egg, butter, sugar and salt.</li>
    <li>Slowly add the flour, baking powder and milk, stirring carefully with a wooden spoon, until you have a thick but cohesive batter.</li>
    <li>Using two spoons, scoop some of the batter and scrape it off into the hot oil. Make sure to work in batches, frying about 5 to 6 beignets at a time, flipping them occasionally for even browning. They should take 3-4 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
